# Steps Wizard Developer Guide

This guide is intended for developers working with the steps wizard component to understand its structure, usage, and available statuses.

---

## Overview

The steps wizard is a UI component that shows progress across multiple steps of a process. Each step has a status (e.g., pending, completed, error), and may include additional information such as optional flags or errors.

---

## Status Types

Each step can have one of the following statuses:

### 1. `pending(default status)`
- Default status.
- Appears clickable if it‚Äôs the first step or the previous one is `completed` or `optional`.
- Greyed out if it's not reachable yet.

### 2. `optional`
- Styled with **yellow** background and border.
- Allows skipping the step and still moving forward to the next.
- The step number is highlighted in yellow.
- Used when the step is not required to continue the process.

### 3. `error`
- Styled with **red** background and border.
- Indicates invalid or incomplete user input.
- Clicking it should bring focus to the error area and optionally display a tooltip/message.

### 4. `completed`
- Styled with **green** background and border.
- The step number is replaced with a ‚úîÔ∏è tick mark.
- User can click to revisit or edit the completed step.

## Step Accessibility Rules

1. **First step** is always active/clickable unless disabled explicitly.
2. A step becomes **clickable** if:
   - The previous step is `completed` or `optional`.
3. A step is **disabled** (unclickable) if:
   - It is not the current or next possible step.
   - It hasn't yet met conditions to be accessed.
   - It appears grey with reduced opacity.

---

## Interactivity

Clicking on a step will:
- Change its status to `completed` (with green tick).
- Move to the next step (if available).
- Allow backward navigation to completed steps.

|------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `completed` | Shows tick, clickable to revisit                  |
| 2    | `optional`  | Clickable, yellow style, can skip                 |
| 3    | `pending`   | Clickable if step 2 is `completed` or `optional` |
| 4    | `error`     | Red border, must fix before proceeding            |
